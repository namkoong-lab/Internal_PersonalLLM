# PersonalLLM

**PersonalLLM** is designed to facilitate research in Large Language Model (LLM) personalization. Unlike traditional preference-style datasets, PersonalLLM offers a diverse set of prompts and responses that reflect a wide range of user preferences. Additionally, we provide an evaluation set for various personalization algorithms.

## Getting Started
